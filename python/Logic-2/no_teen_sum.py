# Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().

  # return sum([fix_teen(i) for i in [a, b, c]])
  return sum([i for i in [a, b, c] if i in [15, 16] or not i in [j for j in range(13, 19+1)]])

def fix_teen(n):
  return n if n in [15, 16] or not n in [i for i in range(13, 19+1)] else 0
