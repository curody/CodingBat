# For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "def round10(num):" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as round_sum().

def round_sum(a, b, c):
  arr = [a, b, c]
  return sum(round(i) for i in arr)

def round(num, base = 10):
  mod = num%base
  return num - mod if mod < 5 else base - mod + num
